# Cat or Dog Convolutional Neural Network
***
## What is this?
This repository contains a jupyter notebook which includes the data preprocessing for the training and the test sets, followed by the creation and training of a convolutional neural network capable of distinguishing between the image of a cat or a dog.

It also contains a production ready code snippet which takes input an image and classifies it as a cat or a dog.

The dataset has also been provided.

## How to run?
1. Clone the repository on your machine.
2. Open the cat_or_dog_cnn.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code.
3. Run the code cells one by one until "Part-4" to train the model on the training set.
4. To make a single prediction, use the given images or provide your own image by simply changing the path in the `tf.keras.utils.load_img()` function.
